1. Supervised learning is labeled data that analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function (often used for predictions). However, Unsupervised learning is finding hidden structures in an unlabled data. 
2. The claim is false because Scikit-learning does not have power to visualize data without other data libraries and are used for delveloping training models.
