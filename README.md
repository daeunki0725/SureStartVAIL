- I am looking foward to learn how to impelment my creativity to machine learning and AI. I am also excited to work on the makeathon project with my team members and grow as a traniee in this field throught our curiculaum and networking events.

1. Supervised learning is labeled data that analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function (often used for predictions). However, Unsupervised learning is finding hidden structures in an unlabled data. 
2. The claim is false because Scikit-learning does not have power to visualize data without other data libraries (such as Pandas, Graphviz, and matplotlib) are used for delveloping training models.

1. Tensors are arrays that are multidimensional and are usually represented by multiple directions. Matrix is a Tensor and Tensor is some sort of generalization of matrices. Tensors are utilized in Machine Learning as they can hold multi-dimentional data, manipulate them, and update calculations extremely fast. 
2. It seems that there are a lot of layers that goes into Machine Learning, however, through TensorFlow, the layers of images could be broken down and classified similar qualities.
